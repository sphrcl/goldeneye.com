					<p>Visit GoldenEye Press.</p>

					<h3>Are there other GoldenEye resorts?</h3>
					<p>No. GoldenEye is unique. However, there are other Island Outposts. They include Strawberry Hill, The Caves and Geejam, as well as private villas, all located in Jamaica. The atmosphere at every Island Outpost property is casual and friendly. Fresh local food, and efficient and unobtrusive service, are hallmarks of each. And the Island Outpost properties share a common sensibility that makes them appealing to the sophisticated, laid-back traveler—seeking a personal and relaxed experience. Just like you feel when staying in the home of good friends.</p>
					
					<p>Here's what Condé Nast Traveler has to say about Island Outpost properties: Like a close-knit family of wildly attractive, intelligent and anarchic kids, they are utterly independent and quite impossible to separate from one another. But something they have all inherited is Blackwell's easy charm, his amused and iconoclastic view of the world, his sense of fun and style, his instinct for beauty.</p>

					<h3>Can I take a helicopter to GoldenEye?</h3>

					<h3>Where, exactly, is GoldenEye?</h3>
					<p>GoldenEye sits on a bluff facing the Caribbean Sea in the quiet village of Oracabessa on Jamaica’s fabled North Coast. This dramatic coastline—with secret coves, private beaches and a lagoon—is unlike any other in the world.</p>
					
					<h3>What is GoldenEye's address?</h3>
					<p>Oracabessa, St. Mary, Jamaica<br/>
						Tel: 876.622.9007 Fax: 876.622.9008<br/>
						E-mail: info@goldeneye.com</p>
					
					<h3>What is the weather like at GoldenEye?</h3>
					<p>The average temperature is 77°F (25.5°C) during the winter months and 82°F (28°C) in the summer. February is the coolest month, while July and August are warmest. On the North Coast, where GoldenEye is located, the morning and evening tradewinds blow in off the Caribbean Sea and cool down the property naturally. Yes, it does rain. But showers are usually brief, dramatic and followed by hours of lovely sunshine. And the water? The turquoise blue Caribbean Sea is always warm, inviting and refreshing, with temperatures averaging between 80°F (26.6°C) about 84°F (28.8°C). </p>
					
					<h3>What is the time zone in Jamaica?</h3>
					<p>Jamaica is on Eastern Standard Time. The island does not change its clocks for Daylight Savings Time. That means that in summer, Jamaica is on U.S. Central Time.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<img src="images/faq5.jpg" alt="Golden Eye"/>
					</figure>
					
					<h3>What is the local currency?</h3>
					<p>Jamaica is home to the JMD, otherwise known as the Jamaican dollar. Not that you need to worry about this. Everything at GoldenEye, and most other places, can be paid for in US dollars. Still, it’s nice to keep some colorful JMD in your wallet, should you want to stop for a jelly (coconut water) or a cup of fish tea while out on a drive.</p>
					
					<h3>Should we be worried about staying safe in Jamaica?</h3>
					<p>We promise, you won’t feel anything but safe during your stay. Our staff loves GoldenEye, has worked here for years and call it their home. The town of Oracabessa, in which GoldenEye is located, is a lovely, sleepy country town. Plus you when you go off exploring the island, we’ll send you with a guide who’s on home turf.</p>
					
					<h3>Is the water safe to drink?</h3>
					<p>Yes, the water in Jamaica is safe. We provide bottled water for a better taste, but you can brush your teeth, shower, etc. and not think twice.</p>

					<h3>Is there a pool?</h3>
					<p>The best pool at GoldenEye is the Lagoon. Think of it as a 250 meter pool! Part seawater and part fresh spring water, the Lagoon is always warm, always clear and almost always completely tranquil. It's ideal for either splashing around or swimming laps. (Four laps equal a kilometer.) Additionally, there is the fresh water pool at the Bizot Bar, and the signature GoldenEye splash pool, both on Low Cay Beach. Fleming Villa has it’s own, private fresh water pool. </p>
					
					<h3>What should we know about the the beaches at GoldenEye?</h3>
					<p>Low Cay Beach is the main beach at GoldenEye—500 smooth, sandy feet of beach shaped like a French croissant. Wata Sport Beach, located just below the Gazebo, is the headquarters for all water sports activities. Our water sports guides, helpers and instructors are trained lifeguards and skilled sailors. They will arrange for everything from beach towels and snorkeling equipment to kayaks, glass-bottom boat rides and Jet Skis. Speak with any of them if you are interested in lessons or would like to go snorkeling on the many coral reefs close by.</p>

					<h3>What are some of the most popular activities for guests visiting GoldenEye?</h3>
					<p>Swimming. Sunning. Snorkeling. Kayaking. Paddle boarding. Jet Skiing. Wave running. Deep-sea fishing. Pole fishing. Birding. Nature walking. Scuba diving, Horseback riding. Arts and crafts. Backgammon. Tennis. Trips around the island, including an afternoon-into-evening visit to Firefly...</p>			
								
					<h3>What is Firefly? Why should we visit?</h3>
					<p>Firefly has the most stunning view in the Caribbean. The property has a magical legacy that spans centuries and has been both sacred and strategic, prized by all who have lived there—from the island’s indigenous people, the Taino, to the notorious pirate-turned-governor-turned-posthumous Sir Henry Morgan.</p>
					
					<p>In 1948, Noël Coward the celebrated wit, playwright, composer, director, actor, singer and one of the great est social figures of the 20th century acquired the property. Originally called Lookout, Coward renamed his Jamaican home, Firefly. Firefly, which stands today just as Coward designed it,  is a modest, modern house however, its history is grand. Over the 20 year period when Coward was in residence, he entertained the most glamorous personalities of his day, from movie stars to literary greats and even Britain’s Queen Mum, who famously stopped in for lunch on her 1965 trip to Jamaica.</p>
					
					<p>Firefly is just about five miles, and a 15-minute drive, from GoldenEye. It is the ideal place to throw a big party (it’s especially popular for weddings) or to visit for an relaxing afternoon picnic. Plan to stay for sunset, when the bright pink, dusky blue and deep gold light show in the sky gets under way.</p>
					
					<p>The front desk will arrange your visit to Firefly.</p>

					<h3>Michael Caine, Kate Moss, Quincy Jones, Johnny Depp… they’ve all planted trees at GoldenEye. How can I?</h3>

				<h3>Everyone raves about the food at GoldenEye. What makes it so good?</h3>
				<p>It’s simple. It’s home-cooked. It’s local. It’s fresh. Traditional Jamaican cuisine, like we serve at GoldenEye, is a fusion of cultures and influences. (Nowhere is the country’s motto Out of many, one people" more apt than when discussing Jamaican cuisine!)</p>
				<p>Every day, dishes on our menu are cooked with fresh seasonal fruits and vegetables organically grown at Pantrepant, our farm in the Trelawny Parish mountains. We buy fresh fish and lobster daily from local fishermen. Jamaica’s herbs and spices— including the fiery Scotch bonnet pepper, pimento, nutmeg, ginger, tamarind and sweet coconut—are world famous. Tropical fruit, such as june plum and soursop, are not only unique to the area, they’re also unforgettably luscious!</p>
				<p>If you have any special requests, specific dietary requirements or restrictions, just let us know.</p>

					<figure class="right dir">
						<img src="images/faq10.jpg" alt="Golden Eye"/>
					</figure>

					<h3>Where are meals served? When?</h3>
					<p>Breakfast and lunch are served at the Bizot Bar overlooking the Caribbean, while dinner is served at the Gazebo restaurant, overlooking the Lagoon.</p>
					<p>Dining hours are flexible; please let us know if you have special requests. Dinner for kids is served 6:30-7:30 p.m. And should you prefer, we’re happy to serve your meals in the privacy of your suite, cottage or villa.</p>

					<h3>What about bar service? Where is the bar, and do you serve any special drinks I should know about?</h3>
					<p>You can’t miss the Bizot Bar, because the sounds of laughter, chit-chat and deep dub reverb echo in the warm air, making it one of the happiest, most-happening spots at GoldenEye.</p>
					
					<figure>
						<img src="images/faq11.jpg" alt="Golden Eye"/>
					</figure>
					
					<p>Chances are, half the crowd will be holding the crushed ice, lime and rum cocktail called the GoldenEye (the same drink you were gratefully served upon your arrival). And the rum? Blackwell’s Fine Jamaican Rum. Now, how many hotels serve a rum “homemade” on property—by the proprietor?</p>
										
					<figure class="right dir">
						<img src="images/faq12.jpg" alt="Golden Eye"/>
					</figure>
					
					<h3>What’s the story behind Blackwell’s Fine Jamaican Rum?</h3>
					<p>Since the 17th century, Island Outpost founder Chris Blackwell’s family have called Jamaica home. In 1916, they went into the rum trade. Today, after tinkering around with some old family recipes, Blackwell has created a new rum inspired by the old-style, richly favored recipe that made Jamaican rum world-famous.</p>
					<p>Blackwell’s Fine Rum is now available in select cities throughout the US. That it was made at GoldenEye makes drinking it right here, on this very spot, that much more tasty.</p>

				<dt><span>Owning at GoldenEye</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<h3>Can non-Jamaicans purchase property in Jamaica?</h3>
					<p>Yes! There are no restrictions on foreigners owning property in Jamaica. Additionally, there are no foreign exchange restrictions currently in Jamaica. Therefore, anyone can send money to Jamaica and from Jamaica, subject to the prevailing exchange rates at the time of transaction, and the Financial Institution being used.</p>
					
					
					<h3>What are the purchaser’s costs in buying property?</h3>
					<p>The purchaser’s cost will range between approximately 5% and 10% of the purchase price with a breakdown as follows:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>1/2 Stamp Duty: 1.5% of the purchase price.</li>
						<li>1/2 Registration Fee: .25 % of the purchase price.</li>
						<li>Purchaser’s Attorney’s fees on Transfer: 2 – 4% of purchase price + General Consumption Tax on these attorney’s fees (17.5%).</li>
						<li>1/2 Vendor’s attorney’s cost for preparing the Agreement of Sale +  General Consumption Tax on these attorney’s fees (17.5%).</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>* If financing is being sought this will also add to the purchasers costs.</p>
					
					<h3>How is property tax evaluated in Jamaica?</h3>
					<p>Property tax is based on the unimproved value of the land, resulting in nominal annual real estate taxes.</p>
					
					<h3>Is it necessary to retain an attorney to act in the transfer of real estate?</h3>
					<p>Jamaican law requires that a vendor retain an attorney to draw up the agreement for sale and to oversee the process until the transfer has been completed.</p>
					<p>A purchaser however is not required to retain an attorney and can act on his/her own behalf in the transaction. It is however recommended that purchasers employ an attorney at law to act on their behalf.</p>
					
					<h3>How long does a sale transaction take?</h3>
					<p>If it is a cash purchase, the transaction cannot take less than 30 days, but usually can be concluded within 60 days. If it will be financed by a mortgage it will take a minimum of 90 days, depending on how quickly the requirements of the lending institution are satisfied. </p>
					
					<h3>If something happens and the purchaser cannot complete the sale will the purchaser lose the down payment?</h3>
					<p>A purchaser is required to pay 10% at the signing of the Reservation Agreement to hold the unit in question.  If the purchaser decides not to move forward in advance of executing the overall Sales Agreements, the 10% reservation deposit shall be refunded.</p>
					
					<h3>Are there restrictions on how many days a year a home owner can spend at GoldenEye? </h3>
					<p>No!  We really hope GoldenEye will be your home away from home.  You can use it as often as you like.  We just ask that you provide us a schedule of your anticipated dates a year in advance.</p>
					<p>Of course the more the residence is available for resort purposes, the more a homeowner will stand to make on their house.</p>
					
					<h3>Do homeowners get access to the resort?</h3>
					<p>Yes!  Homeowners have the right to use the beach, pools, and all other public areas of the property.  They can also use all non-motorized water sports equipment, etc. that our guests enjoy free of charge.</p>
					
					<h3>As a homeowner, what share of the income do I receive if my residence is put in the pool to be used for resort purposes?</h3>
					<p>Island Outpost takes a 20% sales and marketing fee on the net room revenue and then all proceeds are split 50/50 between GoldenEye and the homeowner. After this split, both GoldenEye and the homeowner both reserve 2.5% in a sinking fund to be used for repairs on the residence.</p>
					
					<h3>What are the maintenance fees?</h3>
					<p>Currently the maintenance fees are as follows:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>One Bedroom Beach Cottage: $400/month</li>
						<li>Two Bedroom Beach Cottage: $600/month</li>
						<li>One Bedroom Lagoon Suite:  $300/month</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The maintenance fees are paid on a quarterly basis and are deducted from any proceeds otherwise due to the homeowner.</p>
					
					<h3>Are there any other fees or expenses associated with ownership?</h3>
					<p>In addition to maintenance and the nominal real-estate tax mentioned above, all home owners are required to pay for their insurance and utilities. However, please note that GoldenEye takes care of all expenses on the homeowner’s behalf and deducts these amounts from the quarterly funds remitted to the homeowner.</p>
					<h3>Can non Jamaicans qualify for financing in Jamaica?  And if so, what documents pertaining to the property do financial institutions require from the purchaser in order to process a loan application?</h3><br/>
					
					
					<ul>
						<li>Yes!  Non Jamaicans can qualify for financing.  The documents required are as follows:</li>
						<li>A signed agreement for sale.</li>
						<li>A recent appraisal / valuation report.</li>
						<li>A recent surveyor’s identification report.</li>
						<li>Proof of payment of up to date water bill.</li>
						<li>A certificate of payment of property taxes.</li>
						<li>In some cases where applicable, proof of payment of insurance and maintenance charges.</li>

					<h3>Are there any other policies I should know about?</h3>
					<p>GoldenEye is a very special resort. Unlike other hotel properties, it's not built to a cookie cutter plan; rather, it follows the natural contours of its lush and rugged terrain. In developing the property, we have tried to keep the integrity of the natural land. This means there are roads that might be uneven and definitely unpaved. We ask that you keep this in mind when reading through our waiver—and that you remain aware that we do everything possible to ensure our guests’ safety during a trip to any of the Island Outpost properties. What follows is our liability policy. You will receive this along with your confirmation email, and will be asked to sign upon arrival to the resort.</p>
