						<h2>Fun in the Sun, Play on Land,<br/> Splash in the Sea</h2>

						<h4>The four-acre Lagoon, the centerpiece of GoldenEye, was created when Oracabessa was a banana port. Today it forms a peaceful ring around Santa Maria Island and extends under the GoldenEye bridge and into the Bay. GoldenEye’s main beach, Low Cay, is 500 feet of smooth sand that’s ideal for sunning, relaxing and swimming. Our fun, fitness-focused experiences include lagoon rafting, stand-up paddleboarding and core balance and strength instruction. Guests can also mountain bike to Firefly, play tennis, or simply jog along the coast. Other uniquely inspirational and experiential activities are available, including sunset yoga, and coral restoration.</h4>
